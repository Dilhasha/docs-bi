# Enterprise Integrations Patterns

Ballerina Integrator (BI) usage patterns and best practices for implementing enterprise integrations. These patterns are based on the Enterprise Integration Patterns book by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf. Each sample is a simplified version of a real-world integration scenario.

The following Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) are implemented using Ballerina Integrator (BI):

## Messaging Systems
- [Message](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/message)
- [Message Endpoint](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/message_endpoint)
- [Message Translator](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/message_translator)
- [Pipes and Filters](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/pipes_and_filters)

## Messaging Channels
- [Channel Adapter](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/channel_adapter)
- [Messaging Bridge](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/messaging_bridge)
- [Point to Point Channel](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/point_to_point_channel)

## Message Construction
- [Document Message](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/document_message)
- [Event Message](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/event_message)
- [Format Indicator](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/format_indicator)
- [Message Sequence](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/message_sequence)

## Message Routing
- [Aggregator](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/aggregator)
- [Message Filter](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/message_filter)
- [Process Manager](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/process_manager)
- [Routing Slip](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/routing_slip)
- [Splitter](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/splitter)

## Message Transformation
- [Content Enricher](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/content_enricher)
- [Content Filter](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/content_filter)
- [Normalizer](https://github.com/wso2/integration-samples/tree/main/EI%20patterns/normalizer)
