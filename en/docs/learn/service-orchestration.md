# Service orchestration

In this tutorial, you’ll create a service to process appointment requests for hospitals. The service will call multiple backend services sequentially, using data from each call to inform the next. This approach integrates several services into one, known as service orchestration.
To implement this, you’ll build a REST service with a single resource in Kola extension and then run the service. The resource will receive user requests, make the necessary backend calls, and respond with the appointment details.

The flow is as follows.

1. The user sends an appointment request to the service.
    ```json
      {
        "patient":{
          "name":"John Doe",
          "dob":"1940-03-19",
          "ssn":"234-23-525",
          "address":"California",
          "phone":"8770586755",
          "email":"johndoe@gmail.com",
          "cardNo":"7844481124110331"
        },
        "doctor":"thomas collins",
        "hospital_id":"grandoaks",
        "hospital":"grand oak community hospital",
        "appointment_date":"2024-11-06"
       }
    ```
2. Extract necessary details from the request (e.g., hospital, patient, doctor, etc.) and make a call to the hospital backend service to request an appointment. A response similar to the following will be returned from the hospital backend service on success. 
    ```json
      {
       "appointmentNumber": 1,
       "doctor": {
          "name": "thomas collins",
          "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
          "category": "surgery",
          "availability": "9.00 a.m - 11.00 a.m",
          "fee": 7000
       },
       "patient": {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "dob": "1940-03-19",
          "ssn": "234-23-525",
          "address": "California",
          "phone": "8770586755",
          "email": "johndoe@gmail.com"
       },
       "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
       "confirmed": false,
       "appointmentDate": "2023-10-02"
      }
    ```
3. Use the hospital ID and the appointment number and call the hospital backend service to retrieve the fee for the appointment. The response will be similar to the following.
    ```json
      {
        "patientName": "John Doe",
        "doctorName": "thomas collins",
        "actualFee": "7000"
      }
    ```
4. Finally, call the payment backend service to make the payment and retrieve the reservation status.
   ```json
     {
      "appointmentNo": 2,
      "doctorName": "thomas collins",
      "patient": "John Doe",
      "actualFee": 7000,
      "discount": 20,
      "discounted": 5600.0,
      "paymentID": "f130e2ed-a34e-4434-9b40-6a0a8054ee6b",
      "status": "settled"
    }
   ```

6. Click on the **`Add Service`** button.

### Step 3: Define types
1. Click on the **`Add Construct`** button and select **`Type`**.
2. Select **`Import a JSON`** from the Type dropdown.
3. Generate record types corresponding to the response from the hospital backend service by providing a sample of the expected JSON payload. The values are given below.
    
    |Record Name|Sample JSON value| Make Separate Record Definition |
    |---|---|------------------------|
    |ReservationRequest|```{"patient":{"name":"John Doe","dob":"1940-03-19","ssn":"234-23-525","address":"California","phone":"8770586755","email":"johndoe@gmail.com","cardNo":"7844481124110331"},"doctor":"thomas collins","hospital_id":"grandoaks","hospital":"grand oak community hospital","appointment_date":"2024-11-06"}```| ☑️                     |
    |ReservationStatus|```{"appointmentNo":1, "doctorName":"thomas collins", "patient":"John Doe", "actualFee":7000.0, "discount":20, "discounted":5600.0, "paymentID":"e560ea82-1c42-4972-a471-af5c1ad4995f", "status":"settled"}```| ☑️                     |
    |Appointment|```{"appointmentNumber":12345,"doctor":{"name":"Dr. Alice Carter","hospital":"Green Valley Hospital","category":"Cardiology","availability":"Mon-Fri, 9 AM - 5 PM","fee":200},"patientName":"Emma Johnson","hospital":"Green Valley Hospital","confirmed":true,"appointmentDate":"2024-11-20T10:00:00"}```| ☑️                     |
    |Fee|```{"patientName":"Emma Johnson","doctorName":"Dr. Alice Carter","actualFee":"150.00"}```|                        |
     
4. The final types will look like the following.

    See supported client configurations in the [HTTP Client Configurations](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/2.12.2#ClientConfiguration).

### Step 5: Design the resource
1. The service will be generated with a default resource named `greeting`. Click on the service to view and update the resource details.
2. Click on three dots that appear in front of the `greeting` resource and select edit to view and update the resource details.
3. Define an HTTP resource that allows the **`POST`** operation on the resource path `categories/[string category]/reserve` and accepts the category path parameter (corresponding to the specialization). 
4. Add **`ReservationRequest`** as a parameter indicating that the resource expects a `JSON` object corresponding to **`ReservationRequest`** as the payload. 
5. Add `ReservationStatus`, `http:NotFound`, and `http:InternalServerError` as the response types.
   <a href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/service-orchestration/resource.gif"><img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/service-orchestration/resource.gif" alt="Resource" width="70%"></a>
6. Click on the **`Save`** button to save the resource.
