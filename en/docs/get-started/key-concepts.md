# Key Concepts

WSO2 Ballerina Composer is an all-in-one integration solution that simplifies digital transformation by offering a powerful, configuration-driven approach. It enables developers to visually create integration solutions using an intuitive, low-code graphical interface, making the process faster and more accessible.

## Entrypoint
An entry point refers to the place in the code where the execution of a integration begins. It is the first function or method that is called when the program starts running. 
In Ballerina Composer, there are 3 types of entry points:

1. Service: A service is a network-accessible API that is defined by a set of resources and methods. Start your integration with a HTTP service.
2. Automation: Triggers integration with a task. Perfect for scheduled or one-time jobs.
3. Trigger: Initiate your integration with a Trigger. Best for event-driven actions from external sources.

## Connections
Connections are used to connect to external systems and services. They are used to interact with external systems and services, such as databases, APIs, and messaging systems. 
Ballerina Composer provides a wide range of connectors that can be used to connect to various systems and services.

## Functions
Functions are reusable code blocks that can be called from different parts of the integration. They are used to perform specific tasks or calculations.

## Types
Types are used to define the structure of data in Ballerina Composer. They are used to define the shape of the data that is passed between different components of the integration.

## Configurations
Configurations are used to define the settings and parameters of the integration. They are used to configure the behavior of the integration and its components.
